# CensusScheduler

Census Scheduler is a shift management and staff scheduling application without access to the internet. The primary goal is to build a system that is comprised of a local server and multiple tablets for volunteers.

see https://github.com/mbhewitt/CensusScheduler/blob/main/OPS_Install.md for server install and https://github.com/mbhewitt/CensusScheduler/blob/main/Tablet_setup.md for tablet setup.

Please bear with us as a lot of this documentation needs updating/creating.
