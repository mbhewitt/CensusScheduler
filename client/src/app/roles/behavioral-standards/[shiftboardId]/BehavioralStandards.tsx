                Burning Man&apos;s culture honors and promotes freedom of
                expression, unless and until that expression harms others. Black
                Rock City is also a place where people test boundaries and
                explore their limits. All members of the BRC Census team are
                expected to navigate these inherent contradictions while doing
                their best to be respectful and thoughtful of the people who may

                This document describes several different settings and
                situations, and provides general guidelines for expectations of
                behavior of all members of the BRC Census team. The first
                section outlines general guidelines that are applicable to any
                setting and any time. The second addresses specific situations
                which might arise in Black Rock City, and the third addresses
                expectations specific to volunteers when they are actively
                representing the BRC Census team. The fourth section discusses
                situations that may occur between members of the BRC Census
                team.

                Members of BRC Census leadership are committed to being
                available to any member of the BRC Census team who wishes to
                share feedback, thoughts, concerns, requests for assistance, or
                any other communication. As Black Rock City staff, these
                individuals have access to a wide range of resources available
                to them to help them to do their jobs and navigate difficult
                situations. They rely on their fellow team members to notify

                Volunteer Coordinators, members of BRC Census management, and
                other key volunteers maintain (and regularly check) their
                Burning Man email addresses to enable communication in the
                off-season. The Census Management group alias
                census@burningman.org can always be used to bring issues to the
                attention of BRC Census leadership. (As of Jan 2024, the members
                of this group alias are Sonder-Census Manager, Captain
                Mew-Scheduling Coordinator, and JOBI-Communications
                Coordination. They are also reachable at sonder@burningman.org,
                mu@burningman.org, and jobi@burningman.org) If direct
                communication with another member of BRC Census leadership is
                preferred, the group alias can be used to request contact
                information.

                On-playa, members of BRC Census leadership can be found at the
                Census Lab or reached via radio on the Census channel while
                shifts are active. Additional on-playa resources are made
                available by other teams, including peer mediators, private

                If a situation ever arises in which a member of the BRC Census
                team feels uncomfortable bringing an issue to the members of BRC
                Census leadership at large, they may ask to discuss the
                situation privately with the member of leadership with whom they
                feel most comfortable. That individual will be able to provide
                resources outside of BRC Census, such as the People and Ops team
                within Burning Man Project, so that an appropriate resolution
                can be found.

                Black Rock City is a setting that invites experimentation.
                Participants are encouraged to push their own boundaries and
                explore possibilities that would be impossible anywhere else.
                This is part of why people (including members of the BRC Census
                team!) expend so much effort to go to Black Rock City. However,
                it is important to remember that when we explore limits and
                boundaries, we often infringe on others in ways both foreseeable
                and unforeseeable.

                offense or discomfort, sometimes intended by the artists and
                sometimes not. In these situations, members of the BRC Census

                While exploring Black Rock City, it is our hope that all members

                integrity, and empathy. It is hoped that our team members will

                especially right or especially wrong. It is also our hope that
                they will listen when others speak out in kind. When necessary,

                In addition to the general expectations and the expectations in
                Black Rock City, there is an additional level of responsibility
                taken on by all BRC Census volunteers any time they are actively
                representing their team (e.g., wearing a BRC Census lab coat,
                BRC Census hoodie, etc.) When a person has a negative
                interaction with someone wearing Census regalia, there are risks
                of long-lasting impacts for the entire team.
              </Typography>
              <Typography>
                Members of the BRC Census team regularly ask Black Rock City
                residents (including members of other Burning Man staff and
                volunteer departments) to participate in or enable our research,
                or to conduct outreach on our behalf. That data is critical to
                our team&apos;s overall reason for existing, and one of the best
                ways to encourage participation is by generating positive
                associations with the BRC Census team and its members. Whenever
                possible, BRC Census team members should keep this in mind and
                behave in a way that will make the people around them want to
                help us with our core mission.

                It is important to note that there may be situations where some
                degree of conflict is unavoidable. Participants who are eager to
                get to their camps may be frustrated at the delay on Gate Road,
                and members of other staff departments may not understand the
                need for them to modify their processes to allow BRC Census to
                operate smoothly. Well-meaning individuals may have thoughts on
                how BRC Census could improve processes, and may express
                displeasure if those suggestions are not immediately adopted.
              </Typography>
              <Typography>
                In these situations, members of the BRC Census team are expected
                to remain polite and respectful at all times. They are also
                encouraged (when applicable) to remain firm about their
                intention to follow existing procedures according to the
                training and instruction they have received. In most cases, a
                Shift Lead or some other member of BRC Census leadership should
                be notified immediately so that they can take part in the
                conversation and take any appropriate action. Even if it is
                unnecessary or impossible to bring members of BRC Census
                leadership into the situation as it occurs, notification after
                the fact is critical so that any needed follow-up can occur.

                personalities, cultures, etc. It is important that all members

                respectful. If the conflict could lead to an interruption in
                responsibilities, it is vitally important that team members
                request assistance from a Shift Lead or some other member of BRC
                Census leadership. (Even if no interruption of responsibilities
                is likely, this step is highly encouraged!)

                In some cases, the environment or situation may preclude
                immediate resolution to an issue between team members. In some
                cases BRC Census team members may be asked to hold off on
                further discussion or action until a safer and more appropriate
                setting can be arranged and all participants have had time for
                any necessary self-care. In these cases, team members may be
                asked to accept an alternate role, lane assignment, etc. to
                prevent recurrence or exacerbation of an issue during a shift.

              <Typography>
                Even if it is unnecessary or impossible to bring members of BRC
                Census leadership into the situation as it occurs, notification
                after the fact is critical. The members of BRC Census leadership
                cannot address issues if they are not aware of them, and
                patterns of behavior cannot be identified unless each individual
                behavior is reported to the appropriate members of the team.

                If members of BRC Census leadership receive reports of behavior
                that violates any of the standards listed above, they may reach
                out to the parties involved in an attempt to learn more about
                the situation. Members of BRC Census leadership will, at all
                times, do their best to be fair and to let all parties be heard.
                This process may include requests for mediated conversations
                between individuals and/or assistance from other departments
                within Burning Man. If a situation involved members of another
                Burning Man department, reports may be provided to other
                department managers so that the situation can be addressed
                appropriately.

                At the conclusion of these discussions and inquiries, verbal or
                written warnings may be administered to one or more BRC Census
                volunteers. In some situations, failure to abide by these
                standards will result in a volunteer&apos;s removal from the BRC
                Census team, with or without prior warning. It is also possible
                that no additional action will be taken.
